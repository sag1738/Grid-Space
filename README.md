# GridSpace Frontend

GridSpace is a web application built using Next.js (TypeScript) that allows users to book workplaces and manage memberships. This repository contains the frontend code for GridSpace.

## Frontend Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/asl1n/GridSpace.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd GridSpace
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

Now, you should be able to access the frontend at `http://localhost:3000` (or whatever port Next.js assigns).

## Additional Notes
- Ensure your backend is running before starting the frontend.
- If you face any issues, check the backend logs (`storage/logs/laravel.log`) or frontend console errors.
- For production, configure environment variables properly and build the frontend using:
  ```sh
  npm run build
  ```
